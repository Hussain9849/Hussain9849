## 100 Days of RTL

I‚Äôm currently on a **100 Days of RTL Challenge** where I design, implement, and verify one digital design module each day.  

Topics covered so far:  
- Flip-Flops (D, T, JK, SR)  
- Counters (Up/Down, Ring, Johnson)  
- Shift Registers  
- Latches  
- FSM Design (Moore & Mealy)  
- Asynchronous & Synchronous FIFOs  
- AHB2APB Bridge  

Stay tuned as I update this repository with my daily progress!

## Projects

### üîπ RTL Design
- **AHB to APB Bridge**  
  Designed and verified a bus bridge supporting AHB master to APB slave communication.  
  - Language: Verilog HDL  
  - Verified using self-checking testbenches  

- **Asynchronous & Synchronous FIFO**  
  Implemented FIFO designs with full/empty flag generation.  
  - Learned about clock domain crossing challenges.  
  - Verified with corner-case scenarios.  

- **Flip-Flop & Counter Designs**  
  Built D, T, JK flip-flops, shift registers, and counters as part of RTL practice.
